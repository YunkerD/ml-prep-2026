# 📂 Previous Works Archive

This folder contains notebooks and exploratory work from earlier units, reliability engineering studies, and foundational data science practice. While not part of the core ML Prep 2026 sequence, these artifacts demonstrate continuity, depth, and academic rigor.

## Purpose

- 🧠 Showcase prior learning and applied analytics
- 🎓 Align with La Trobe MDS subjects such as STM4DS and CSE4PM
- 📊 Support stakeholder-facing insights and technical polish
- 🧭 Track evolution of portfolio from reliability engineering to full-stack ML

## Contents

- `eda-mining-assets.ipynb` – Exploratory sensor data profiling
- `failure-rate-analysis.ipynb` – Weibull modeling and lifecycle forecasting
- `statistical-tests.ipynb` – t-tests and ANOVA for asset comparison

## Notes

Each notebook includes stakeholder commentary and academic alignment. This archive complements the “Live Notebook Previews” section on the homepage and is referenced in the weekly roadmap for progress tracking.
